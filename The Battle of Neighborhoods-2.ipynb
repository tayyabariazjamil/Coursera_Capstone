In this case, a small family run grocery store. \n\nThe first task would be to choose the safest borough by analysing crime data for opening a grocery store and short listing a neighbourhood, where here is a scarcity of grocery stores and yet within close proximity to the city.\n\nI will make use of our data science tools to analyse data and focus on the safest borough and explore its neighborhoods and the 10 most common areas in each neighborhood so that a safe neighbourhood with a demand for grocery stores, can be selected."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Based on definition of our problem, factors that will influence our decission are:\n* finding the safest borough based on crime statistics\n* finding the most common establishments to determine the demand for grocery stores\n* choosing the right neighbourhood within the borough\n\nI will be using the geographical coordinates of Vancouver to plot neighbourhoods in a borough that is safe and in the city's vicinity, and finally cluster the neighborhoods and present my findings.\n\nFollowing data sources will be needed to extract/generate the required information:\n\n- [**Part 1**: Using a real world data set from Kaggle containing the Vancouver Crimes from 2003 to 2019](#part1):  A dataset consisting of the crime statistics of each Neighbourhood in Vancouver along with type of crime, recorded year, month and hour.\n\n- [**Part 2**: Gathering additional information of the list of officially categorized boroughs in Vancouver from Wikipedia.](#part2): Borough information will be used to map the existing data where each neighbourhood can be assigned with the right borough.\n\n- [**Part 3**: Creating a new dataset of the neighborhoods, along with their boroughs, crime data and the respective Neighbourhood's co-ordinates.](#part3): This data will be fetched using OpenCage Geocoder to find the safest borough and explore the neighbourhood by plotting it on maps using Folium and perform exploratory data analysis.\n\n- [**Part 4**: Creating a new consolidated dataset of the neighborhoods, boroughs, and the most common venues and the respective neighbourhood along with co-ordinates.](#part4): This data will be fetched using Four Square API to explore the neighbourhood venues and to apply machine learning algorithm to cluster the neighbourhoods and present the findings by plotting it on maps using Folium."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "**Part 1:** Using a real world data set from Kaggle containing the Vancouver Crimes from 2003 to 2019<a name=\"part1\"></a>\n\n\n####  Vancouver Crime Report \n\nProperties of the Crime Report\n\n*   TYPE - Crime type\n*   YEAR - Recorded year\n*   MONTH - Recorded month\n*   DAY - Recorded day\n*   HOUR - Recorded hour\n*   MINUTE - Recorded minute\n*   HUNDRED_BLOCK - Recorded block\n*   NEIGHBOURHOOD - Recorded neighborhood\n*   X - GPS longtitude\n*   Y - GPS latitude\n\nData set URL: https://www.kaggle.com/agilesifaka/vancouver-crime-report/version/2"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
